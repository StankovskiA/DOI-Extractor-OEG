# DOI-Extractor-OEG


### Tool for extracting all paper's name and DOI from OEG publications.
<br>
They are extracted from two main resources:

1) https://portalcientifico.upm.es/es/ipublic/entity/16247 , corresponding to all papers from OEG.

2) Papers.csv with already extracted data from some OEG papers, which is located in the folder ExistingPapers.

<br>
The resulting information is placed in Outputs folder, which include:

- A dois.txt containing all the dois from the two resources

- A name-doi.csv, containing the title and the doi of every paper found
